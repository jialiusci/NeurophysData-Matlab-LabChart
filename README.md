# NeurophysData-Matlab-LabChart
The purpose of this project is to automate data collection process in neurophysiology research and reduce time needed to complete data collection, by linking data collected in LabChart to Matlab and take online analysis in MatLab. LabChart is one of the most commonly used software in neurophysiology research for recording data from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and H-reflex for example. While some online analysis can be performed in LabChart, real-time determination of AMT and RMT can not be achieved. Determination of AMT/RMT through manual selections of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from hundreds of TMS trails can take up to hours to complete, during which patients with neurological conditions may be esaily fatigued. Real-time streaming LabChart data from MatLab entails immediate analysis which helps reduce substantial amount of time needed and man power. 

We are currently using it for TMS and H-reflex research with spinal cord injury population. No additional files needed, this "Main.mlapp" should run on itself to function. 

Description of the 3 sub-sections: 

1) Online determination of whether motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) meet AMT or RMT criteria. 
2) Recruitment curve analysis. 
3) H-wave and M-wave analysis (in development).
