# NeurophysData-Matlab-LabChart
The purpose of this project is to automate data collection in neurophysiology research, by linking data collected in LabChart to Matlab and take online analyses in MatLab. LabChart is one of the most commonly used software in neurophysiology research using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and H-reflex for example. While some online analysis can be performed in LabChart, real-time determination of AMT and RMT can not be achieved. Determination of AMT/RMT through manual selections of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from hundreds of TMS trails can take up to hours to complete and elongate data collection process, during which patients with neurological conditions are quickly fatigued. Real-time streaming LabChart data from MatLab entails immediate analysis which helps reduce substantial amount of time needed and man power. 

We are currently using it for TMS and H-reflex research with spinal cord injury population. No additional files needed, this "Main.mlapp" should run on itself to function. All codes were developped under guidance provided my ADInstrument visualbasic codes.

Description of the 3 sub-sections: 

1) Online determination of whether motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) meet AMT or RMT criteria. 
2) Recruitment curve analysis. 
3) H-wave and M-wave analysis (in development).
